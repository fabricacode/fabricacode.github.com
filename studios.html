      Our work is created in studio areas which individually investigate projects along themes. Studio areas are dynamic and take advantage of quick bursts of project development. Each studio investigates a topic for a limited amount of time and then moves on. Since themes are continually changing our researchers continually change as well to accommodate the new skills required for project investigation. Teams shift fluidly and grow and shrink according to the current initiatives. Each studio is run by a studio lead who acts as the principal investigator of that subject matter.

      Researching and investigating current approaches to dying, through experimental design focusing on end-of-life care, assisted dying and suicide. Including broader issues around health and the environment, preventative and holistic healthcare, to challenge the notion of death in stark opposition to life. Utilising a wide range of approaches and perspectives, projects will develop new dialogues and models to engage with some of the most deep-rooted taboos in contemporary society.<br/>

      Exploring the emerging DNA of 21st century social movements, enterprises and cultures, especially working with United Colors of Benetton. Addressing social and cultural issues; wars, censorship, diversity, politics, we explore how to use arresting imagery to capture attention, and then lead people towards tools, which build genuine capacity and resilience.<br/><br/>

      The Document Studio focuses on documentary and documentation as an integral part of the creative process. We employ the languages and techniques of audio-visual documentation and digital storytelling to reflect on current social and cultural issues. We investigate the blurry line between fiction and non-fiction. We document with the aim to understand, but we use documentary to pose questions rather than give simplistic answers.<br/><br/>

      Our Making and Designing studio uses design to research, articulate and convey and evoke stories about people and places. The cultures and practices of making are also explored through this studio, yet the focus is on producing artifacts and events in order to understand and connect. Often using object-making and image-making, the studio’s output includes exhibitions, objects, books, events.<br/><br/>

      Our Networked Politics studio explores how our various cultures of decision-making, from formal politics to informal protest, are radically changed in the age of the network. We are looking at the changing nature of protest - Occupy, Arab Spring, Istanbul, Wikileaks and beyond -  including the relationship between physical spaces, cities and contemporary digital tools. We're interested in the shifting modes and possibilities of contemporary decision-making (currencies such as Bitcoin; cultures such as open source and radical transparencies; governance models like liquid democracy, crowd-funding and crowdsourcing; forms of organisation such as communes and autonomous states).<br/>
      <br/>
      NetPol creates exhibitions, media, apps and artifacts in order to articulate research about how our various cultures of decision-making, from formal politics to informal protest, are being transformed as a result of The Network. We work on design and communications projects with clients from governments to galleries, in order to effect real change, as well as producing our own media, documentaries, platforms and objects, software, scenarios and events.<br/><br/>

      Journalism continues to radically transform, its dynamics — at the mainstream and the edges — reinvented every year throughout the first decades of the 21st century. Yet some patterns also persist. This studio explores the practice, culture and meaning of journalism in our time, through projects. Our particular take on journalism is in being, as the original strapline of Colors had it, “about the rest of the world”, and we understand that “otherness” through culture, geography, time and perspective.<br/><br/>

      We explore the relationship between sound and objects, spaces, people and interactions. We use sound as a starting point, but the outcome might be objects, media, events and artefacts. Sound is one of the least understood yet most powerful senses (you can easily close your eyes but not easily close your ears) and we develop projects that articulate the relationship between sound and communication.<br/><br/>
